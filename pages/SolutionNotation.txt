The solution always starts with the coin layout and the starting positions of the four priests. Next comes the length of the solution, and finally a list of the moves. The moves are separated by commas, and each move has the following parts:
* Priest - A=Arms, C=Crowns, M=Moons, S=Suns
* Direction - L=Left, R=Right, U=Up, D=Down (Note that "up" and "down" mean up and down the page, not up and down the mountain.)
* Steps - only for left or right moves. This is the number of steps on unoccupied spaces.
* (+Jumps) - only for left or right moves that include jumps over other priests.

Example:
A151223343151M
C542002455003S

The first few moves on this board might go as follows:
* AR1 - The Arms priest moves one space to the right.
* AD - The Arms priest moves one space down to the 5 coin.
* CR2(+1) - The Crowns priest moves two unoccupied spaces to the right plus a jump over the Arms priest.
